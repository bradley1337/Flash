# Flash Twitch Bot (Outdated)
###### Development Started: May 2021 | This will be put into a discord bot. (cba right now tbf)

1. Put tokens in tokens.txt

Tokens are the ```auth-token``` cookie on twitch (https://dev.twitch.tv for learn more info on the ```auth-token``` and ```OAuth access tokens```)

Many 'paid' discord servers allow 'twitch bot' services. This is what is basically what is used to do so, the only hard part is getting tokens if you do not know what you're doing; Google/GitHub may be of use if you categorize yourself as one of these people :)

Not sure if this works anymore, have not tested this since ages. (Feel free to contribute/fork the project or make issue reports)
